Tired of not having any Danish BERT embeddings? Well, you came to the right place! <br><br>
This is a package for making danish word/sentence embeddings for your very own NLP project, with BERT! 
See how to get started below ⬇️<br><br>

## How to install?
```
pip install danish-bert-embeddings
```
## How to use it?
```
from danish_bert_embeddings import BertEmbeddingsDK # it sounds like a website, need to find another name for that one 😂
bert = BertEmbeddingsDK()
embedding = bert.embed('sætning eller ord som du gerne vil have embedded')
```
### Thanks to
- Lars Kjeldgaard (GitHub: smaakage85) for helping me package the project and publish it on PyPi.
- Jens Dahl Møllerhøj (GitHub: mollerhoj) og BotXo for pre-training a danish version of BERT.
